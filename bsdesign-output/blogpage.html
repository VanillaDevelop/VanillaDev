        <h2>Future of the Website<br></h2>
        <p>Currently, I am working on updating the website, making it purely HTTPS accessible to improve security as well as general search engine results. This is generally an easy task with services such as LetsEncrypt, but is a bit more difficult on a shared webhost, as one does not have full accessibility to the server, and methods of actually acquiring and enabling a certificate can differ between webhosts. Other than that, I will continue making small adjustments to the website to improve the visual appearance.<br><br>In the near future (presumably 1-2 weeks), I will add an “Article” section to the website. This will be a space for larger projects which may require considerable explanation of their goals (such as ML systems or text analysis) but which feel too important to be reduced to a simple blog post. With this addition, I should be able to provide the first article straight away, which will revolve around a sentiment analysis with respect to a recent video game launch.<br><br>I will add a “Projects” section to the website once I have the first software project which I can present here. This project, which is a small Vue-based web application leveraging VueX and the vue-router, is currently in the works. My estimate for how long it will take to complete is 4-8 weeks, though this could change for the better or worse depending on how much time I can invest into it. Rather than an “Article”, which is more akin to a less formal scientific paper, this “Project Description” will contain mostly meta-information about the development process as well as resources used and some brief explanation of the core features.<br><br></p>
        <h2>Project Pace</h2>
        <p>In the future, I plan to continue this current model of concurrently working on two projects at a time, where one is more code-focused, and the other is more research-heavy. This allows me to shift my focus between problems that are more algorithmic and those that are more analytical. However, this is only a rule of thumb. Since there is a number of smaller projects that I would like to finish, I may consider also working on a third, longer term project, such as a game or a commercial application. However, considerable planning would have to go into such a project, and the details would likely not be publically available.<br><br></p>
