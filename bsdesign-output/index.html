                <p>When I was in my young teenage years, I first learned about programming and automation through a language called "AutoIT". It was a small, niche scripting language, and its main purpose was the automation of simple repeated mouse- or keyboard actions. I used this language to write very simple autoclicker scripts for an online game I was playing at the time. However, I remember that even back then, I saw the potential in what was possible through what more experienced developers created at the time, such as complex bots which could read the game state from memory and send targeted packets directly to the server without the need of keyboard commands ever being executed. Among other things, I consider this to be a core influence into what eventually made me want to become a software developer.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-10">
                <p>I had my first experience with proper programming in the technical college I attended, where I learned the fundamentals of OOP in C# and Java. I developed a small Flappy Bird clone from scratch using XNA, an old framework for game development which eventually provided the structure the MonoGame library would follow. Other than that, I would spend much of my time in those years implementing simple frontends using WinForms (and eventually WPF), which often called Web APIs or scraped data from the web in some form. Unfortunately, most of these projects have been lost to time. During this time, I also took a few short-term internships, which allowed me to gain some insight into how software development is applied in practice.<br></p>

                <p>During my university education, I learned more about writing clean codebases, and had an opportunity to see what fields really interest me. I discovered my love for Python as a "swiss army knife" of programming, as well as my interests in data analysis and machine learning. I still love playing video games, and will often spend weekends working on small side projects that can improve my experience in some way. I use these projects as an opportunity to learn new skills and apply them directly to practical problems. As the educational chapter in my life begins to wrap up, I decided that it would be good to keep a portfolio of passion projects, and thus decided to write this website to keep track of my thoughts and contributions.</p>

                <p>Text mining, classification, prediction and generation are all fields I am interested in. Several of my projects explore the capabilities of public models such as GPT or BERT, as well as classification libraries and metrics and their internal structure.<br></p>

                <p>While my previous attempts at game development have either been very long ago or in the scope of university projects, I am working on concepts for eventual small titles or game jams when time allows for it. I have some prior experience with Unity.<br></p>

        <h1 class="text-center mb-3">What I do</h1>
        <p class="two-columns"><br>I am currently a full-time student working on my master's degree in Software Engineering. As I plan on finishing my degree without delays, this takes up a good chunk of my time. I usually invest some of my free time into broadening my horizons when it comes to software development. I like learning about new frameworks and technologies by applying them to toy projects that are personally useful to me in some way. Through this, I have learned the basics of&nbsp;<strong>Unity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vue</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>TensorFlow</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>NodeJS</strong>, and other frameworks. On top of that, I also have professional backgrounds through my education in creating applications with a variety of languages such as&nbsp;<strong>C#&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Python</strong>. Generally, I will be working on one or two such projects simultaneously. On top of that, I also enjoy data analysis and its applications especially within the field of machine learning. I like reporting my findings and experiments in these domains, and so I occasionally write&nbsp;<strong>articles</strong>&nbsp;about them. I try to apply some scientific rigor to these articles, including the use of known metrics and best practices to draw conclusions, while also attempting to stay within the realm of what is both enjoyable and interesting to read. On my&nbsp;<strong>blog</strong>, I post occasional updates about my projects in order to stay on top of regularly updating my web presence.<br></p>
